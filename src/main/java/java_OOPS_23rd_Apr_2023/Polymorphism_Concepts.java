	//poly means many
	//morph means forms
	
	//There are 2 types of polymorphism in java
	
	//1. Compile time polymorphism(static polymorphism). It is also known as HAS-A Relationship
	
	//How is it achieved?
	//1. Method overloading
	//2. Method name should be same. Class should be same. Parameters/arguments will be different
	
	//This is handled by the compiler
	
	
	//2. Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism). It is is known as IS-A relationship
	
	//How is it achieved?
	//Method overriding
	//1. Inheritance has to be there
	//2. Method name should be same. Class should be different. Parameters/Arguments will be same
	//3. Access modifier of Child class overridden method should be higher or equal to access modifier of parent class method
	
	//private methods cannot be overriden. Only overloaded
