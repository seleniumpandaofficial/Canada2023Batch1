	//single level - there is one parent and there is one child class. So child class inherits from parent class
	//multi level - grandparent class. parent class is the child class of grandparent. Child class is the child of parent
	//parent inherited from grandparent. Child inherited from parent. So technically child also inherits from grandparent
